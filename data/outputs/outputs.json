Anyway, I believe the team, although bit delay and less communication at recent days, they really tried best for paper and cooperation. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link came finally last week, I think. Also, kindly remind me please, if the doctor still plan for the acknowledgments section edit before he sending again. Because I didn’t see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so. Overall, let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future targets",

In any case, I believe that the team, although somewhat delay and less communication in the last few days, is really trying best for paper and collaboration. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer connection finally arrived last week, I think. Please also remind me if the doctor still work for the recognitions section before sending it back. Because I haven't seen this part for good, or I may have missed it, I apologize if so.
